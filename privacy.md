</p>


<h4>1. Non-personal Data</h4>

<p>
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data mFadliishak collects about the use of mFadliishak Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.

<p>
mFadliishak may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable mFadliishak to identify you.
</p>
<p>
mFadliishak may use Game Analytics and Fabric Analytics tool in order to develop and analyze use of the Services. Analytics companies may access anonymous data (such as your IP address or device ID) to help us understand how Services are used. They use this data solely on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user. If you wish to opt-out from Game Analytics and Fabric Analytics, please follow this link: http://www.gameanalytics.com/privacy.html and https://fabric.io/privacy

</p>

<h4>3. Ad Serving Technology</h4>

<p>
mFadliishak reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by mFadliishak or mFadliishak’ partners and contractors. mFadliishak may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. mFadliishak or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. mFadliishak or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including but not limited to for purposes of determining your coarse location), Device ID, MAC, software, applications, hardware, and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
</p>
<p>
You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for mFadliishak may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services. Although mFadliishak takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, mFadliishak does not have access to or control of third party technologies.
</p>
<p>
mFadliishak may display to you behaviorally targeted advertising.

If you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are not displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services. Additionally please note that if you “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.
